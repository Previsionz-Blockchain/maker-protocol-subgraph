1. **handleGrab:** Vault liquidation

>function grab(bytes32 i, address u, address v, address w, int dink, int dart)


_It's also referred as "*CDP Confiscation*"_

This function is executed by the Liquidation module trough the "Bark method" and modifies following entities:

1. User: the user is created with the urnAddress<function param arg2 "u">

2. User: the liquidator is created with the  liquidatorAddress<function param arg3 "v">

3. CollateralType: the ilk is loaded with the ilkAddress<function param arg1 "i"> and modified as follows:
	- the "debtNormalized" attr<art> is decreased by adding the "dart" value (negative signed float number)

			ilk.Art = _add(ilk.Art, dart); // vat.sol ln213


	- the "totalDebt" attr<dtab> ir re calculated by multipliying the "debtNormalized" times the 
	"colalteralType's rate"

			int dtab = _mul(ilk.rate, dart); // vat.sol ln215

4. Vault: the urn is loaded with the urnAddress<function param arg2 "u"> and modified as follows:

	- the "collateral" attr<ink> is decreased by adding the "dink" value (negative signed float number)

			urn.ink = _add(urn.ink, dink); // vat.sol ln211

	- the "debt" attr<art> is decreased by adding the "dart" value (negative signed float number)
			
			urn.art = _add(urn.art, dart); // vat.sol ln212

5. Collateral: the gem is created or loaded with the composition of the CollateralType ilkAddress<function param arg1 "i"> and the User liquidatorAddress<function param arg3 "v">

	- the "amount" is increased by substracting the "dink" value (negative signed float number)
		
			gem[i][v] = _sub(gem[i][v], dink); // vat.sol ln217

6. SystemDebt: the sin is created or loaded with the vowAddres<function param arg3 "w">

	- the "amount" is increased by substracting the "dtab" value (negative signed float number)
	
			sin[w]    = _sub(sin[w],    dtab); // vat.sol ln218

7. SystemState: the systemState is loaded with it's singleton id.

	-	the "totalSystemDebt" attr<vice> is increased by substracting the "dtab" value (negative signed float number)

			vice      = _sub(vice,      dtab); // vat.sol ln219
